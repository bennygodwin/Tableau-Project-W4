# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goals of this Tableau project are as follows:
* Data visualization to quickly identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.
* Data analysis to uncover new insights and understand complex relationships in the data.
* Dashboarding and reporting to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions.
* Data storytelling to tell compelling stories with data by creating interactive visualizations that highlight key insights and drive engagement.
* Data sharing to easily share their data visualizations and reports with others within their organization, as well as with external stakeholders.

## Process
### The Canadian Open Dataset comprising of the following was used to answer the questions:
* Weekly earnings from 1.1.2001 to 15.4.2015
* Housing constructions from 1955 to 2019
* House prices from 1.1.2005 to 1.9.2020
* Housing_price_index from November 1979 to September 2020
* Office_realestate_index from November 1979 to September 2020
* Consumer index from November 1979 to September 2020

## Results
Option 1: Standard Final Project
* The trend of house prices in Canada has generally seen an upward trend over the last 40 years. However, the rate of increase has varied regionally and over time. Additionally, housing markets are subject to fluctuations, and periodic corrections or slowdowns have occurred.
* After 2005, the trend in house prices in Canada has continued to see overall growth, but with some minor fluctuations. The actual benchmark prices, which are a measure of the average price of a representative home in a particular market, have varied depending on the region and market conditions.
* The average house price in Canada varies depending on the region and city. In general, the largest provinces such as Ontario and British Columbia have higher house prices compared to smaller cities and rural areas.
* The differences in house prices between different districts in Canada are found to increase over time. These cities have seen significant growth in house prices, particularly in certain neighborhoods, leading to wider disparities in house prices between districts. On the other hand, some regions and smaller cities may have experienced more modest price growth or even declines in some instances, often due to factors such as a slowing economy or oversupply in the housing market.
* A regression line is a statistical tool that is used to model the relationship between two variables. In this case, a regression line can be used to model the relationship between a consumer price index and a housing price index. A consumer price index measures changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by households. A housing price index measures changes in the prices of homes in a given market or region. The R-Square value of the above relationship is 0.648 and P-value is less than the benchmark value of 0.05. Hence, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.

## Challenges 
The main challenge was having different units in a table while making a comparison. This can lead to incorrect conclusions and misinterpretation of the data. It was not easy to understand the units. As different units are used, it was difficult to make direct comparisons between the data, and to derive a conclusion. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time with Tableau, here are some of the things I would do to further explore and analyze data using the software:
* Connect to a wider range of data sources: I would take the time to explore and connect to the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the data.
* Enhance data visualization: I would experiment with different visualization options to find the best way to communicate insights from the data.
* Perform more complex calculations: I would the calculation options in Tableau and use them to perform more in-depth analysis on the data.
* Create interactive dashboards: I would create interactive dashboards that can be used to explore and analyze data in a more dynamic way.
Overall, with more time with Tableau Project, I would aim to deepen my understanding of the software and explore new ways to analyze and communicate insights from data.
